# Semantic-Text-Similarity-NLP

This repository will explains the Latent Semantic Analysis project.
Data Extraction : 
Firstly, I have choosen a simple term, like Machine Learning as concept, explore for the contextual words and related keywords.
In my case, I have used, Machine Learning as concept, Artificial Intelligence, Algorithms as context and clustering, data science, regression etc as keywords.
Accordingly, i have searched the concept under google patent and came up with the top 10 url (ML patents links) from it. I have copied each url and have extracted the whole text from the urls.
Later, i have merged the texts and done data cleaning over there.
Model Creation : 
I have tried, TF-IDF Model approach and Latent Semantic Analysis Model approach. The model is into running phase with not very good accuracy. Looking to optimize the same.
